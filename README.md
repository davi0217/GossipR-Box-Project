# ♻️ Recycling Project

A web application that  looks forward to engage university students in recycling

## 🌱 Goals

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- 
- APIs, such as :

- Backend built with Flask in Python

## 📦 Usage
- The web is pretty intuitive and constantly changing, since I'm trying to upgrade it little by little
-You can check the news related to the field of your interest
-You can check wether your university is part of the project
-Create an user is possible, as well as logging in and logging out
-You can leave a comment to other users and receive comments from others, as well as liking them
-This comments will only be available if, by Friday, your university gets to a certain goal. You can check the weekly progress in your personal section
-Since this is a demo, you'll also get the option to publish them anyway
